    "### Description of the code\n",
    "The goal of Blackjack is to either get a hand that adds up to 21 or have a better hand than the dealer. If you go over 21, (number cards = their number values / kings, queens, jacks, and 10s = 10 / aces = either 1 or 11), you bust and automatically lose. In order to reach 21, you have the option to hit, which means you draw another card, or stand, which means you will keep the cards you have in hopes they are better than the dealer's cards. \n",
    "\n",
    "The classes in this code setup everything you need to play the game including the cards, the deck, and the option to bet. \n",
    "\n",
    "The functions setup the game itself by asking for your bet, showing yours and the dealer's card, and giving you the option to hit or stand. They then provide the conclusion of the game. \n",
    "\n",
    "The gameplay is done using loops and condition checks. "
